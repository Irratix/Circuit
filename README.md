# Circuit

<<<<<<< HEAD
lmao look at this garbage piece of code

3 main features to implement:

- Microchips. Singular nodes that can contain entire circuits. The entire chip can have a variable number of inputs and outputs.
- Autosorting. Automatic method to make a circuit organized.
- Autosimplifying. Automatic method to simplify the set of gates, or maybe put them in CNF or something as such.

lmao this is even more garbage it's not even done

currently working on microchips
