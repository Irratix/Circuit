# Circuit

This is a circuit editor. It has all the basic functionality you probably expect (power sources, lights, basic gates). It's mostly made for fun. There's 3 functions I want to add as a challenge, where I have no idea how difficult they are:

- Microchips. Singular nodes that can contain entire circuits.
- Autosorting. Automatic method to make a circuit organized.
- Autosimplifying. Automatic method to simplify the set of gates, or maybe put them in CNF or something as such.

As of writing this I have started working on microchips, yet they are far from functional.
